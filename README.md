## About
        The aim of this project is to get familiar with the [Pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io) library. By using this module, we can control the mouse and keyboard by just creating simple scripts. In this project, I use this benefit to write code that automates clicking on the popcat, and if you want to stop, you can execute [fail-safe](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=fail-safe#fail-safes) by dragging the cursor to any of the four corners of your screen. After the fail-safe trigger, the screenshot will be taken and saved as a PNG file.

## Libraries
 - [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io)
